DataFrame - the primary data structure in pandas, 
representing a two-dimensional table similar to 
an Excel worksheet. It consists of rows and columns, 
where each column can hold a different data type (e.g., 
strings, integers, dates).

head() - a method used to quickly inspect the beginning of a 
DataFrame by returning the first 5 rows.
