- plot - function is used to draw points (markers) in a diagram. Params:

The alpha parameter allows adjusting data point transparency, 
highlighting regions with the highest density concentration. 
These areas correspond to the most frequently represented 
data points in the dataset. The resulting scatter plot accurately 
traces California's outline while clearly revealing high-density 
locations like Los Angeles and San Diego.
